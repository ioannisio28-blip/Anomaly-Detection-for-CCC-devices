# Anomaly-Detection-for-CCC-devices
This model has been build to detect anomalies in cloud devices telemetry data. 

The file `main.py` is the main script that it must run. The `Evaluation.py` is as a module which the main.py takes the class for the evaluation. The `reconsturcted.error` is the list of the reconstuction errors of the given data. The class computes and give the windows that are consider anomalies.
